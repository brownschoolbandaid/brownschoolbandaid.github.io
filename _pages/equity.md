## Other Schools have safer facilities

{% include gallery caption="Click on the images for a larger version" %}

Every other school in the Somerfille school system has better facilities. Argenziano has a swanking new playground, East Somerville has beautiful playsets. Kennedy has a great gym, and an amazing Swimming Pool. 

It is understandably hard to retrofit a 120 year old school with new facilities. But it is not unreasonable that the city makes its existing facilities safer.

## Brown's blacktop could lead to lawsuits

The Somerville School district has opened itself upto lawsuits since the
blacktop leads to so many injuries. It's not hard to see why: conditions of the
blacktop surface are bad.

To add to this the school itself is not compliant with the ADA. This opens it
up to double jeopardy and a cruel irony: the injuries its students can incur might prevent them from going to their class in school.
