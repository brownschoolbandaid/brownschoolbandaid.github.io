Despite being around since 1900, the Benjamin Brown School has the worst playground in the Somerville Public Schools. While other SPS schools have multiple play structures, basketball courts, soccer fields, a rock climbing wall – even a swimming pool – the Brown only has a bleak, cracked asphalt surface. Furthermore, the Brown has no interior recreation space.
 
It is understandably hard to retrofit a 120 year old school with new facilities. But it is not unreasonable that the city makes its existing facilities safer.

The Brown School Blacktop leads to so many injuries. It's not hard to see why in the omage above: the surface is hard, and to make matters worse, the condition of the surface is bad. There are cracks and potholes. Recently a student tripped in one of these and hurt his head. The ambulance had to be called.
