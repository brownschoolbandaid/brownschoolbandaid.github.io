## The Brown School

Built in 1900, the Brown School is the oldest elementary school in Somerville. The Brown offers a small school, family atmosphere with a strong emphasis on preparing students to excel academically and personally, providing them with the tools to become productive and positive members of society.

## The PTA

An entirely volunteer 501(c)(3) non-profit organization, the Brown School Parent Teacher Association facilitates ways for parents to support the school, teachers, and each other, to make our children’s education more fruitful and fun.

We encourage parents and guardians from every student’s family to join and participate! We hold a community activity every month, such as Popsicles After School, a Harvest Fair, Tropical Dance, STEAM Night, a Book Swap, and more. We also provide buses and some funds for every class to enjoy a field trip. We also arrange after school clubs led by parents who have generously offered to share their talents.

The PTA Officers participate in the Somerville Council of PTAs to coordinate with other schools across the City. As part of this effort, we also participate in the PTA Scholarship committee to raise money for several scholarships awarded to outstanding graduating Somerville High School students.
