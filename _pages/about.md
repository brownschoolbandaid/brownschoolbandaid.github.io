## The Brown School

Built in 1900, the Brown School is the oldest elementary school in Somerville. The Brown offers a small school, family atmosphere with a strong emphasis on preparing students to excel academically and personally, providing them with the tools to become productive and positive members of society.

## The PTA

The Brown School Parent Teacher Association facilitates ways for parents to support the teachers, and each other, to make our children's education fruitful and fun.

We encourage parents and guardians from every student's family to join and participate!

We hold a community activity every month, such as Slush After School, a Harvest Fair, Tropical Dance, Swim Night and more. Two Scholastic Book Fairs are organized and staffed by parents every year. We also provide a bus and some funds for every class to enjoy a field trip. We, also, arrange after school clubs led by parents who generously offered to share their talents.

The PTA Officers participate in the Somerville Council of PTAs, and attend the monthly meetings. At these meetings, we network with the PTA leaders from the cityâ€™s other schools, sharing information and strategizing to make the most of our role as parent leaders. As part of this effort, we also participate in the PTA Scholarship committee, which organizes an annual Dinner Dance to raise money for several scholarships awarded to outstanding graduating Somerville High School students.
