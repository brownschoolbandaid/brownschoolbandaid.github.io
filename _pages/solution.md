The Brown School PTA has been asking the school system and the city to quickly put in a softer turf surface. This is not a permanent solution, but, rather, a #brownschoolbandaid to keep our children safe.

Our solution can be implemented for less than 10% of the cost of the original proposed renovation that was paused in early 2021. If we act swiftly, it could be ready for the start of the next school year. This is a small price to pay for the safety of our children.

We simply replace the existing asphalt surface with a level, soft surface in Summer 2022, as shown in the green area below.
