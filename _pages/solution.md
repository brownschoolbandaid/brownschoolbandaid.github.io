The Brown School PTA has been asking the school system and the city to quickly put in a softer turf surface. This is not a permanent solution, but, rather, a #brownschoolbandaid to keep our children safe.

Our solution can be implemented for less that $250,000 and by the start of the next school year. This is a small price to pay for the safety of our children.
