## The Brown School attracts students from all of Somerville

![image-full](/assets/images/browncatchment.png){: .full}

Built in 1900, the Brown School is the oldest elementary school in Somerville. The Brown offers a small school, family atmosphere with a strong emphasis on preparing students to excel academically and personally, providing them with the tools to become productive and positive members of society.

## The Brown School is amonst the 10 best Schools in Massachussets

The Somerville School District is understandably proud of the Brown: despite
the poor facilities, the school has a very dedicated set of teachers and staff,
and a very involved ond helpful set of parents.

It is not surprising that the Brown School is well regarded in the state, even
winning awards. It is not surprising that families all over Somerville indicate
it as a preference and the map above shows that the district is resposive to
their demands.

It is time for the district to be responsive to the needs of the school and its students. We know that plans are afoot for an overall [renovation](https://www.somervillema.gov/brownschoolrenovation), and we appreciate the school district and the city's initiative on that. 

However, the safety of the school children is paramount, and cannot wait. Thus the situation on the blacktop needs to be tackled immediately.
