## The Brown School attracts students from all of Somerville

![image-full](/assets/images/browncatchment.png){: .full}

Built in 1900, the Brown School is the oldest elementary school in Somerville. The Brown offers a small school, family atmosphere with a strong emphasis on preparing students to excel academically and personally, providing them with the tools to become productive and positive members of society.

The Somerville School District is understandably proud of the Brown: despite
the poor facilities, the school has a very dedicated set of teachers and staff,
and a very involved ond helpful set of parents. Children excel in small learning communities.

The Brown School has been recognized as a MA Commendation School. Commendation Schools are recognized for their high achievement, high progress, and/or narrowing of proficiency gaps.

The Brown School was recently ranked the #10 Best Elementary School in Massachusetts

It is not surprising that the Brown School is well regarded in the state, even winning awards. It is not surprising that families all over Somerville indicate it as a preference. 

It is time for the district to be responsive to the needs of the school and its students. While there has been discussion for decades of a Brown schoolyard renovation and even a building renovation, the City has not articulated any timeline or committed any money to putting a shovel in the ground.

However, the safety of our school children is paramount and cannot wait. Thus the situation on the blacktop needs to be addressed immediately.
