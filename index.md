There have been 188 injuries at the brown school playground since school started this fall. Scrapes. Head Injuries. A finger sliced. 3 children with broken bones. Just this week, a child was taken to the hospital in an ambulance..

WE URGENTLY NEED A SOLUTION.

The Brown School PTA has been asking the school system and the city to quickly put in a softer turf surface. This is not a permanent solution, but, rather, a #brownschoolbandaid to keep our children safe.
