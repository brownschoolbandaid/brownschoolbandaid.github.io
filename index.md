## WILL YOUR CHILD BE NEXT?

![image-left](/assets/images/injury1.jpeg){: .align-left}

There have been 188 injuries at the brown school playground since school started this fall. Scrapes. Head Injuries. A finger sliced. 3 children with broken bones. Just this week, a child was taken to the hospital in an ambulance..

WE URGENTLY NEED A SOLUTION.

The Brown School PTA has been asking the school system and the city to quickly put in a softer turf surface. This is not a permanent solution, but, rather, a #brownschoolbandaid to keep our children safe.

 Our solution can be implemented for less that $250,000 and by the start of the next school year. This is a small price to pay for the safety of our children.
