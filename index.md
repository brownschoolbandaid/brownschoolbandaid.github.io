## Support a Safe Playground

![image-left](/assets/images/injury1.jpeg){: .align-left}

There have been 188 injuries at the brown school playground since school started this fall. Scrapes. Head Injuries.  3 children with broken bones. Just this week, a child was taken to the hospital in an ambulance..

WE URGENTLY NEED A SOLUTION.

The Brown School PTA is asking the City and SPS to quickly put in a softer surface this summer. This is not a permanent solution, but rather a simple #brownschoolbandaid to keep our children safe. 

*Let's patch our playground, not our kids!*

We’re asking the City to simply replace the asphalt with a level and softer surface. Our bandaid solution can be implemented during SUMMER 2022 for ~10% of the cost of the “paused” full playground renovation project. This is a small price to pay for the safety of our children.

## FAQs

**What do you want?**

To simply replace the existing asphalt surface with a level, soft surface in Summer 2022. The larger more complicated questions regarding future renovations should not be an excuse for inaction today.

**What’s the hurry?**

There are a number of drivers to the timeline:

- The urgency of the situation and injuries that continue to happen to the kids on a daily basis.
- The overwhelming preference to do a playground renovation during the summer when the weather is warm and the playground is unoccupied.
- City budgetary cycles and requirements to publicly solicit bids mean that we need action now if we want shovels in the ground this summer.

**What happened to the old playground design?**

Using Community Preservation Act funding, the City started a design process in 2019 and 2020 to renovate both the Brown and the WSCS playgrounds. There were a number of design charrettes held and progress looked imminent. In March 2020, the final public design meeting was cancelled amidst the onset of the COVID pandemic.
